HERE WORD_LIST IS A LIST CONSISTING 5 LETTER ENGLISH WORDS. THEN PYTHON WILL GENERATE A RANDOM CHOICE FROM THE GIVEN LIST AND THEN WE WILL ASK THE USER TO INPUT A 5 LETTER WORD.THEN THE TWO WORDS WID WILL BE COMPARED LETTER BY LETTER. IF THE LETTERRS MATCH WITH THEIR INDEX THEN THE WORD WILL TURN GREEN, IF THE LETTERS MATCH BUT NOT THEIR INDEX THEN IT'LL TURN YELLOW AND IF THE LETTERS DO NOT MATCH THEY WILL TURN RED. IF THE GREEN LETTERS ARE EQUAL TO OR MORE THAN THREE THE USER WILL GET A OUTPUT OF 'WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER', IF YELLOW LETTERS ARE EQUAL TO OR MORE THAN 3 THAN THE USER WILL GET 'BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME' AND LASTLY IF RED LETTERS ARE EQUAL TO OR MORE THAN 3 THAN THE USER WILL GET ' ARJUN KAPOOR DOES BETTER ACTING THAN YOUR GUESS'.
